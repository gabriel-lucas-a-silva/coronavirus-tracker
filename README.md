# coronavirus-tracker

This project is a coronavirus tracker that shows all the reported cases in the globe. It was basically built using Spring Boot, Lombok, JUnit, Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.

I created this application by seeing a youtube tutorial, and with that I learned:
- a little bit about Http calls with Java
- how to access csv data
- and solidified some knowledges about unit testing
- about decimal formart
- a little bit about @PostContruct and @Scheduled
